# Project status

- Date: 2026-08-31
- Version: 0.1.0.dev10
- Stage: Phase 4 audited evidence-bundle assembly implemented
- Product maturity: local CLI MVP with software-peer collection and audited aggregation; not production-ready
- Highest ForgeGate-owned evidence: LOCAL_HOST_TEST
- Hardware evidence: not applicable; no device access performed
- Remote/publication status: local only; no remote repository created

## Implemented

- repository/package scaffold;
- strict project, policy, and evidence-bundle contracts;
- safe configuration loader;
- `doctor`, `validate-config`, and `export-schemas` CLI surface;
- generic sample project and policies;
- architecture, evidence, security, compatibility, roadmap, and verification
  documentation;
- Windows/Linux/macOS CI definition;
- immutable-in-session artifact registration with explicit root, size, regular
  file, stable-read, and SHA-256 checks;
- bounded JUnit XML collection into one normalized `test.summary` record;
- explicit collection warnings and rejections with stable codes;
- `collect-junit` CLI preview and committed golden output;
- Cobertura/coverage.py XML collection with observed-count precedence and
  repository/package/module scopes;
- LCOV collection with strict record state, count validation, module scopes,
  and explicit disclosure when only branch summaries are present;
- `collect-coverage-xml` and `collect-lcov` CLI previews and golden outputs;
- bounded SARIF 2.1.0 collection with strict JSON parsing, verified-success
  invocation state, rule/location/fingerprint normalization, and explicit
  zero-result summary evidence;
- `collect-sarif` CLI preview, generic fixture, and golden output;
- strict `forgegate.benchmark.v1` artifact contract with deterministic committed
  JSON Schema drift verification;
- bounded Benchmark JSON collection into one `benchmark.metric` evidence record
  per unique scope/name, retaining value, unit, baseline, and tolerance;
- `collect-benchmark` CLI preview, generic fixture, and golden output.
- deterministic policy evaluation over immutable policy/evidence models at an
  explicit timezone-aware timestamp;
- explicit trust, verification, age, presence, filter, aggregation, strict
  operator, conflict, and mandatory decision-precedence semantics;
- versioned `forgegate.policy-evaluation.v1` outputs with canonical
  fingerprints, evidence references, explanations, and remediation hints;
- `evaluate-policy` PASS/FAIL/REVIEW/ERROR exit codes 0/1/2/3 with committed
  generic PASS and FAIL examples.
- strict, versioned release-candidate, candidate-transition, and transition-result
  contracts;
- deterministic DRAFT creation plus the complete legal state graph with exact
  revision, timestamp, terminal-state, and transition-fingerprint invariants;
- PASS/FAIL/REVIEW terminal transitions bound to matching policy evaluation ID,
  commit, decision, and timestamp;
- stateless `candidate create` and `candidate transition` CLI previews with
  generic DRAFT/EVALUATING fixtures and structural/evaluation-bound Goldens;
- SQLite candidate-store schema v2 with ForgeGate application identity, WAL,
  FULL synchronous durability, foreign keys, exact-version validation, and
  explicit read/write transactions;
- append-only canonical candidate snapshots, content-addressed transitions,
  compare-and-swap current revision, and immutable idempotency responses;
- exact replay, conflicting-key rejection, stale revision protection, bounded
  writer contention, restart recovery, rollback fault injection, and corruption
  detection;
- persisted candidate create/advance/show/history CLI flow while retaining the
  stateless preview commands;
- explicit, validated SQLite v1-to-v2 migration plus exact legacy terminal
  evaluation backfill;
- durable append-only policy-evaluation and release-attestation documents bound
  to the authoritative candidate audit chain;
- self-validating `forgegate.release-attestation.v1` with candidate,
  transitions, policy evaluation, content fingerprints, and unsigned-local
  assurance disclosure;
- deterministic JSON and Markdown rendering with committed Goldens;
- atomic directory publication, exact output replay, conflict rejection,
  symlink/unsafe-target defenses, and stable filesystem errors;
- persisted `candidate migrate-store`, `import-evaluation`, `attest`, and
  `show-attestation` CLI paths.
- frozen consumer-side structural mirror of Analog Validation Studio's public
  `result-export.v1` contract at upstream commit
  `9ac23494b86212928185de9b0eef1c1a82a8c0ea`;
- bounded, strict `collect-analog-validation` artifact path with no upstream
  package import, serial access, analysis rerun, or device operation;
- retained TestRun outcome, limitations, source schemas, metrics, criteria,
  point/evidence/raw-record lineage, exact bytes, and SHA-256 identity;
- automatic evidence-source mapping with current `BENCH_*` capped at
  `system_observed` and warned rather than promoted to physical verification;
- committed sample, Golden normalization, compatibility Schema, adversarial
  tests, architecture/security documentation, and clean-install smoke path.
- strict, bounded loading of collection-result JSON with UTF-8, duplicate-key,
  finite-number, depth, node, and exact-model gates;
- exact re-registration of every referenced artifact so missing, replaced, or
  metadata-conflicting bytes fail before assembly;
- versioned `forgegate.evidence-bundle-assembly.v1` containing a normal
  candidate-bound bundle plus one audited receipt per collector output;
- raw result file SHA-256, normalized result fingerprint, collector identity,
  original artifact references, ordered evidence IDs, and warnings retained;
- duplicate result/source, artifact conflict, evidence ownership, commit, time,
  and content-derived assembly identity invariants;
- `assemble-evidence` plus policy-CLI compatibility with direct bundles and
  validated assemblies;
- committed assembly Schema, Golden, adversarial tests, architecture/threat
  documentation, and clean-install assembly-to-policy smoke path.
